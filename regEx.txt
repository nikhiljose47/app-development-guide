Whole select number/pattern
Operators: +
ex: [0-9]+ , + will match one or more of what precedes it (a number in this case)

ex: 
Problem: Make = 1-664 --> (+1-664)
regEx: ([0-9|-]+$)  --> (+$1)

Exact match
We need to tell end match or start by 
ex: select exact cat from [cat., cat gp, catastophy] -->  ^cat$ --> [cat., <cat> gp, catastophy]
^: placed at the start, this character matches a pattern at the start of a string.
$: placed at the end, this character matches a pattern at the end of the string.
